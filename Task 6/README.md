Task 6-Implement a sample Machine Learning program using a problem statement of your choice.

Project:Myers-Briggs Personality Prediction

Introduction:
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an instrument published by CPP, Inc. designed to
determine a respondent’s preferences in how they see the world and make decisions, based on
four pairings stemming from Carl Jung’s theory of psychological types.In this project,the main focus was given on determining the preferences of the candidates in four different categories known as 'dichotomies'.The four dichotomies are Extraversion-Intraversion,Sensing-Intuition,Thinking-Feeling and Judging-Perceiving.Based on the preferences of the candidates,the MBTI instrument categorizes the person into sixteen different types of personalities,where each type is a combination of four dichotomies.For instance:Intraversion,Sensing,Thinking and Perceiving can be grouped as one dichotomy.
On the other hand Extraversion,Intuition,Feeling and Judging can be considered as another dichotomy.In this way,four dichotomies can be categorized together thereby,making sixteen prediction types.
